# SMGP_BCI_EEG

## Overview
This repository contains the code for my thesis project titled:

**"Bayesian Classification with Split-and-Merge Gaussian Process (SMGP) Prior in EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces"**

The project focuses on modeling EEG signals using the Split-and-Merge Gaussian Process (SMGP) prior and compares its classification performance against reference methods, including Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis (BLDA) and Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis (swLDA).

## Project Structure & Workflow
Go to Python folder and open the following two jupyter notebooks:
- `"SIM_multi_demo_0.ipynb"`
- `"EEG_multi_demo_0.ipynb"`
